This journal will be an intermediate space until the next version is complete.</em></p>\\n<p>This space has been dormant for a while after the last iteration. It’s mainly because I lost the development setup for the blog module and redoing the setup meant spending more time than I could manage. Even then, I tried couple of times to set things up, but midway through had to drop it since it was messing with my mainstream project’s environment. It’s a pain in the butt to do project setups on a workday and not to code or do something else interesting. Besides, the Ruby/Java environments are notorious for these kinda things. Also, I admit the fact that, v5 was done in a frivolous way. I didn’t plan much of it in detail and maybe it was because of the rush to put the site out there. It’s a shame that I couldn’t do much about the blog setup cause I drafted few articles whenever I could find time and then couldn’t really publish it. Some of those articles were interesting ones and few were written in the heat of the moment. Anyhow, I know what needs to be done and to make sure I do that, I‘m gonna record those things here.</p>\\n<p>I was thinking about turning the blog module into a journal, so that I can drop my rough ideas and observations without having to polish them much (For some odd reason, blogging feels a bit more formal compared to journals). I put together this journal overnight using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\\\">GatsbyJS</a>, a static page generator which uses ReactJS/Markdown with other awesome things. Shout out to the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/graphs/contributors\\\">developers</a> for this open source awesomeness. I was planning to develop something like this using ExpressJS and then incidentally found Gatsby which looked much better than what I intended to do anyway. By the time this journal is live, I would’ve taken down <a href=\\\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x04025f5pl0cjww/AADzE4BMA9xyxZlAHZf010MJa?dl=0\\\">the v5 site</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Audio Content</h2>\\n<p>I remember recording audio logs in the past and saving it offline. I started it as a habit during my college days to work on my language skills and that was the time when I didn’t know much about podcasting or audio journals, so that meant I didn’t value it as much as I should have. I lost these logs when transitioning to Dubai. With so much in hand at that time, I couldn’t put any effort in finding them. It’s such a shame to lose those logs since I recorded them at different timelines of my life. I’d love to listen to them now, cause more than the quality of the content, its the context that would’ve been interesting. It’s quite common to lose digital data every now and then, so rather than despairing about it, I’m thinking about publishing audio logs as journals once in a while in this space. The idea is to keep them rough, so I don’t end up spending much time on it and that will keep the content flowing later in the days.</p>\\n<p>As a side note, this Gatsby powered journal will be an intermediate setup until I complete v6 of my site. One of the main reasons to do that, is gather content and reuse it later when v6 is live. So far, I haven’t spent much time on planning v6 but sometime later this week, I will drop another journal with all my hazy thoughts on it. The concepts are in a very primitive stage, so maybe its the right time to log them and start the work simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>On the whole, I’m really excited to see this space getting re-activated. <i class=\\\"em em-smiley\\\"></i></p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 481 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Requirement gathering\",\"date\":\"2016-12-10T15:06:10.004Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"journal/requirement-gathering/\",\"readNext\":\"journal/the-next-iteration/\",\"category\":\"\",\"description\":\"The intricacies of requirement gathering using various tools in design & development of user interfaces\",\"body\":\"<p><em>The intricacies of requirement gathering using various tools in design &amp; development of user interfaces</em></p>\\n<p>Recently, I have been involved in the design and development of an airline servicing app as UI developer. My role also involves working closely with the designers to check with the feasibility of the designs they are producing and feed in the concerns <em>(if any)</em> before starting with the development. This process also works the other way around and it’s an interesting role to play, since the feedback I pass should be constructive for them to keep their work in a progressive path.</p>\\n<p>At times, I found this is to be tricky, since critiquing a design was like threading a fine line which often trigger the designer’s ego or make me look like an absolute duffer, if a false alarm was set off. This meant, I had to be extra careful before passing any comment and also make sure the nature of the comment should be constructive and should help the designer rather than distract the entire process. I enjoyed doing it, since the designer side of me gets excited and usually this is where I get to exercise my design skills (at times, when I wanted to a mockup a flow or screen). Eventually, I took this up as a challenge to pass a feedback only if the particular design doesn’t solve the problem or if it doesn’t work in terms of interaction. After a while, this process also got trickier, passionate designers usually find it difficult to move away from their initial solution. I know this because, I have experienced this and have also heard designers share the same.</p>\\n<p>Iteration is a key part in evolving a design and getting back to drawing board to reinitiate the whole process again in a fairly big team like ours was often a pain in the ass. I say that because, sometimes end-users have a sneak peak of the design and get stuck with it irrespective of the critique or there will strict deadlines to adhere.</p>\\n<p>During one of these crits, a developer pointed out a designer’s habit, which I found it to be interesting. Collecting requirements in wireframe. It sounds a like a personal preference for anyone, even I can’t thoroughly deny doing it but I have not exercised it often to become a habit or preference. I say that because, my go-to tool for note taking in my workplace is Wunderlist (I have a huge number of lists going on in it and I would personally suggest it to anyone) or my primary code editor. Coming back to the topic, requirement gathering is an age-old task and people use tools like text editors or even a paper to do it. After giving it some thought, I realized how bad it is to gather requirements in wireframe.</p>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./subtraction-reference.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Deprecation Notice\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>\\n\\t\\tSurvey result: Primary tool for brainstorming and ideation. <i>Ref: <a href=\\\"http://tools.subtraction.com/brainstorming.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">subtraction.com</a></i>\\n\\t</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Wireframes are usually a place to iterate before jumping into a high-fidelity mock. I have seen at times designers being reluctant to move away from their initial iteration, sometimes it’s a complex scenario they are dealing which is difficult but other times, it’s that wireframe which they used to collect requirement standing as a virtual roadblock. The mind tends to fall back to that wireframe whenever a requirement has to be processed and without the designer realizing it, he/she tend to feed the same solution in most of their iterations. The resultant mockup usually looks close to the wireframe and by the time the designer takes up another iteration (which mostly is after the review process and if the design is flagged to be insufficient), it becomes very late in terms of delivery.</p>\\n<p>Now looking at it retrospectively, setting up a process would help us address these problems. What if, the root cause remained undetected? That would mean, the consequence would never change. It’s difficult to detect a cause like this one, since this remains is an elementary step which often is a personal preference and changing it is slightly difficult. This is the same case even for a developer, sticking to the initial pseudo code without thinking much about problem would lead to a recursive cycle of the same error or issue without arriving to a conclusion. By the time the developer realizes it, good amount of time would have been wasted already.</p>\\n<p>When thinking about it, this is what I am opinionated to as of now, one has to take notes subjectively without thinking about the solution in any shape or form when doing it. Even if, a solution is to be recorded while gathering the requirement its absolutely necessary that, the person has to go the extra mile to find all the other possible ways of solving it, before iterating upon one solution. Also, I am going to take this up in my future conversations with the designers &amp; developers and see how they feel about it.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 482 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"The Next Iteration\",\"date\":\"2016-09-29T20:03:27.663Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"journal/the-next-iteration/\",\"readNext\":\"journal/blogging-restart/\",\"category\":\"\",\"description\":\"I'm doing yet another iteration on my website.

Unlike the previous versions, I want the next one to hold for a longer timespan. In the coming weeks, I will be logging the process here, so it can stay as a reference material.</em></p>\\n<h3>Problem(s)</h3>\\n<p>The last version had some teething problem in terms of logging data across the sections. Whenever I dealt with new content, either the setup was getting in the way or the templates. In hindsight, Angular and Jekyll setup didn’t really workout and gh-pages wasn’t ideal in maintaining the blog and the portfolio as separate entities. Apparently, I lost the setup for the blog and the re-setup was slightly tedious that I couldn’t fire up the blog again. I want to avoid all this aggravation in the next version and keep the logging process simple.</p>\\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\\n<p>The content is going to be in Markdown, so that’s sorted. Now, the choices are between compiling the markdown on the browser using a JS parser or generate a compiled markup during deployment and then serve it as static pages or as services. If I approach it with the latter choice, then the app might involve a back-end module using ExpressJS and to host it, either Heroku or Firebase can a good option.</p>\\n<h3>Designs</h3>\\n<p>I’ve some wireframes sketched out and also designed few mockups to get a direction on the design elements. Upon completion of the mockups, it looked plenty enough for me to start the work. As far as iterations on the designs are concerned, usually I do it on the browser while coding and I want to follow the same approach for this one. The design elements are going to be sort kind of a chart, and the idea is to consume my <a href=\\\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\\\">RescueTime</a> data and display the analytics at a high level for the initial release. This will allow me to gather data from multiple devices and publish it to a single public interface.</p>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./wireframes-homepage.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Landing page wireframes\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Landing page wireframes</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./v6_landing_2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Landing page design mock\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Landing page design mock</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>The idea of habit and time-tracking tools were something that I wanted to develop for sometime. Meanwhile, when I was thinking about the various ways to approach this, Gyroscope was released. It’s an app that consolidates all the user’s data from multiple devices into a single interface. There are few other services which does this but I felt that Gyroscope is superior, mostly because of its beautiful design. I got inspired by the app and then it lead to a rough idea on how I can approach my site. To set things clear, I am gonna try hard enough not to copy anything intentionally from there, which by itself is a stern design challenge.</p>\\n<h3>What’s ahead?</h3>\\n<p>The plan is to keep the portfolio and the blog section separate as similar to the old site. Only this time around, I’ve to be extra careful in managing the modules being independent. To achieve that, I’m planning to build the whole technical solution using a single framework. After using NG2 for an app at work, I was quite convinced with it and I’ve been working with AngularJS for quite sometime now, which has left me wondering on the other JS frameworks that are out there. I want to check things on Aurelia and ReactJS, which looked particularly interesting that on the others. Especially, the React ecosystem sounds more interesting and the added buzz makes it more appealing. I think its the right time to do this project as an experiment with the concepts of React.</p>\\n<p>With some much in the backlog and other projects taking majority of my time, its going to be tricky to manage time in the coming days. But I’ve wasted enough time postponing this work and I’m just excited to work with React.</p>\\n<h4>More designs</h4>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./wireframes-blogpost.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Journal design wireframes\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Journal reference wireframes</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<figure style=\\\"margin-bottom: 50px;\\\">\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./v6_landing_1.png\\\" alt=\\\"Landing page design mock\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Another version of hero section</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 483 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Angular 1.x Component & Routes\",\"date\":\"2017-01-04T09:59:59.932Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"journal/ng-component-routes/\",\"readNext\":\"journal/requirement-gathering/\",\"category\":\"\",\"description\":\"Using the ui-router beta with NG 1.5.x component and porting the old modules & routes to the new UI router.\",\"body\":\"<p><em>Using the ui-router beta with ng 1.5.x component and porting the old routers to the new UI router.</em></p>\\n<p>The intention of this post is to quickly log my experience with an angular 1.5+ based application. I have been working on several angular projects for quite some time now, most of the projects are 1.x based and few are on ng2. Among those 1.x projects, there was huge one which started on v1.3.x sometime back in 2015. I joined this project late 2016 for a new development activity. By this time, I recently completed some work on a ng2 project and from the experiences of it, I knew sooner or later we had to port the current app slowly towards component based approach. So, we planned out the framework upgrades incrementally and started rolling out them one by one. The initial upgrades were quite easy without much breaking changes and when we hit 1.5.0, we were excited to start using the component pattern.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component\\\">angular docs</a> was a good place to start and the <a href=\\\"https://toddmotto.com/angular-1-5-lifecycle-hooks\\\">blog</a> <a href=\\\"https://toddmotto.com/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method/\\\">posts</a> from <a href=\\\"https://toddmotto.com/one-way-data-binding-in-angular-1-5/\\\">Todd</a> were all really helpful in terms of dealing with the new patterns. We started off creating new components as widgets for the app. The app’s core module was a form builder of sorts. This module consisted of many widgets, which were supposed to be reused and the obvious thing was to hit the component approach in full throttle. For the routing part, we looked at the angular’s in-house router, and it had a warning sign for deprecation. But there was reference pointing to use the ui-router’s component version.</p>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./ngrouterannouncement.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Deprecation Notice\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Deprecation Notice: Component Router for AngularJS 1.5</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>The ui-router’s setup was slick since we were already using an old version of ui-router and we had to deal with few broken routes while porting but it was worth it. The form builder module itself deserves a separate log, I will try to cover it later. If not, I will record it as a workflow/case-study in the new site that I’m working on. So, the route configuration looks like this:</p>\\n<script src=\\\"https://gist.github.com/k97/adb17ef598ac2abd3a84ea6e9fc88aec.js\\\"></script>\\n<p>It obviously addressed the concerns of tightly coupling the views with controllers and promote reusable pieces of code. Another big sigh of relief was passing the state via the router. Now thanks to the bindings of ng 1.5 component pattern, we can use and abuse property bindings, event lifecycle hooks and mostly importantly setup the codebase more favorable for a ng-upgrade towards ng2.</p>\\n<p>As a hot tip, one-way binding is pretty easy now with the component pattern and the new router. When creating any component with bindings, just make sure it’s started with one-way binding. Most of the functionality can be achieved this way and if some edge case crops up, then we can revisit that particular property with other means. By using the component bindings, I was able to refactor the old functionality which existed earlier as two-way binding hell to a slick one-way data flow.</p>\\n<p>The next slick thing that was really easy to create and maintain was a dynamic widget creation as scope-isolated components. Long story short, the components were created from a configuration through an attribute directive and then compiled to a DOM element through <code>$compile</code> before injecting back to the app. Once added to the DOM, the element starts to run as an usual ng component. This basically, gave us the flexibility to create dynamic components and reuse the configuration across the app. The directive looks something like the below:</p>\\n<script src=\\\"https://gist.github.com/k97/09ebb01cde3849427bab3327d598b127.js\\\"></script>\\n<p>The next planned activity is to fully modularize the app with ES6 modules before starting the ng-upgrade, which is planned down the line. But looking at the router set up and the lesser state dependency with other modules, I think the upgrade should be quite simple and straight forward.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 484 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t    value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactRouter = __webpack_require__(164);\n\t\n\tvar _sortBy = __webpack_require__(238);\n\t\n\tvar _sortBy2 = _interopRequireDefault(_sortBy);\n\t\n\tvar _moment = __webpack_require__(381);\n\t\n\tvar _moment2 = _interopRequireDefault(_moment);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDocumentTitle = __webpack_require__(378);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDocumentTitle2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDocumentTitle);\n\t\n\tvar _gatsbyHelpers = __webpack_require__(369);\n\t\n\tvar _safeAccess = __webpack_require__(382);\n\t\n\tvar _safeAccess2 = _interopRequireDefault(_safeAccess);\n\t\n\tvar _config = __webpack_require__(371);\n\t\n\tvar _SitePost = __webpack_require__(380);\n\t\n\tvar _SitePost2 = _interopRequireDefault(_SitePost);\n\t\n\tvar _SiteSidebar = __webpack_require__(467);\n\t\n\tvar _SiteSidebar2 = _interopRequireDefault(_SiteSidebar);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\tfunction _possibleConstructorReturn(self, call) { if (!self) { throw new ReferenceError(\"this hasn't been initialised - super() hasn't been called\"); } return call && (typeof call === \"object\" || typeof call === \"function\") ? call : self; }\n\t\n\tfunction _inherits(subClass, superClass) { if (typeof superClass !== \"function\" && superClass !== null) { throw new TypeError(\"Super expression must either be null or a function, not \" + typeof superClass); } subClass.prototype = Object.create(superClass && superClass.prototype, { constructor: { value: subClass, enumerable: false, writable: true, configurable: true } }); if (superClass) Object.setPrototypeOf ?

This journal will be an intermediate space until the next version is complete.</em></p>\\n<p>This space has been dormant for a while after the last iteration. It’s mainly because I lost the development setup for the blog module and redoing the setup meant spending more time than I could manage. Even then, I tried couple of times to set things up, but midway through had to drop it since it was messing with my mainstream project’s environment. It’s a pain in the butt to do project setups on a workday and not to code or do something else interesting. Besides, the Ruby/Java environments are notorious for these kinda things. Also, I admit the fact that, v5 was done in a frivolous way. I didn’t plan much of it in detail and maybe it was because of the rush to put the site out there. It’s a shame that I couldn’t do much about the blog setup cause I drafted few articles whenever I could find time and then couldn’t really publish it. Some of those articles were interesting ones and few were written in the heat of the moment. Anyhow, I know what needs to be done and to make sure I do that, I‘m gonna record those things here.</p>\\n<p>I was thinking about turning the blog module into a journal, so that I can drop my rough ideas and observations without having to polish them much (For some odd reason, blogging feels a bit more formal compared to journals). I put together this journal overnight using <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\\\">GatsbyJS</a>, a static page generator which uses ReactJS/Markdown with other awesome things. Shout out to the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/graphs/contributors\\\">developers</a> for this open source awesomeness. I was planning to develop something like this using ExpressJS and then incidentally found Gatsby which looked much better than what I intended to do anyway. By the time this journal is live, I would’ve taken down <a href=\\\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x04025f5pl0cjww/AADzE4BMA9xyxZlAHZf010MJa?dl=0\\\">the v5 site</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Audio Content</h2>\\n<p>I remember recording audio logs in the past and saving it offline. I started it as a habit during my college days to work on my language skills and that was the time when I didn’t know much about podcasting or audio journals, so that meant I didn’t value it as much as I should have. I lost these logs when transitioning to Dubai. With so much in hand at that time, I couldn’t put any effort in finding them. It’s such a shame to lose those logs since I recorded them at different timelines of my life. I’d love to listen to them now, cause more than the quality of the content, its the context that would’ve been interesting. It’s quite common to lose digital data every now and then, so rather than despairing about it, I’m thinking about publishing audio logs as journals once in a while in this space. The idea is to keep them rough, so I don’t end up spending much time on it and that will keep the content flowing later in the days.</p>\\n<p>As a side note, this Gatsby powered journal will be an intermediate setup until I complete v6 of my site. One of the main reasons to do that, is gather content and reuse it later when v6 is live. So far, I haven’t spent much time on planning v6 but sometime later this week, I will drop another journal with all my hazy thoughts on it. The concepts are in a very primitive stage, so maybe its the right time to log them and start the work simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>On the whole, I’m really excited to see this space getting re-activated. <i class=\\\"em em-smiley\\\"></i></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./articles/2015-09-23-blogging-restart/index.md\n ** module id = 480\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Requirement gathering\",\"date\":\"2016-12-10T15:06:10.004Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"journal/requirement-gathering/\",\"readNext\":\"journal/the-next-iteration/\",\"category\":\"\",\"description\":\"The intricacies of requirement gathering using various tools in design & development of user interfaces\",\"body\":\"<p><em>The intricacies of requirement gathering using various tools in design &amp; development of user interfaces</em></p>\\n<p>Recently, I have been involved in the design and development of an airline servicing app as UI developer. My role also involves working closely with the designers to check with the feasibility of the designs they are producing and feed in the concerns <em>(if any)</em> before starting with the development. This process also works the other way around and it’s an interesting role to play, since the feedback I pass should be constructive for them to keep their work in a progressive path.</p>\\n<p>At times, I found this is to be tricky, since critiquing a design was like threading a fine line which often trigger the designer’s ego or make me look like an absolute duffer, if a false alarm was set off. This meant, I had to be extra careful before passing any comment and also make sure the nature of the comment should be constructive and should help the designer rather than distract the entire process. I enjoyed doing it, since the designer side of me gets excited and usually this is where I get to exercise my design skills (at times, when I wanted to a mockup a flow or screen). Eventually, I took this up as a challenge to pass a feedback only if the particular design doesn’t solve the problem or if it doesn’t work in terms of interaction. After a while, this process also got trickier, passionate designers usually find it difficult to move away from their initial solution. I know this because, I have experienced this and have also heard designers share the same.</p>\\n<p>Iteration is a key part in evolving a design and getting back to drawing board to reinitiate the whole process again in a fairly big team like ours was often a pain in the ass. I say that because, sometimes end-users have a sneak peak of the design and get stuck with it irrespective of the critique or there will strict deadlines to adhere.</p>\\n<p>During one of these crits, a developer pointed out a designer’s habit, which I found it to be interesting. Collecting requirements in wireframe. It sounds a like a personal preference for anyone, even I can’t thoroughly deny doing it but I have not exercised it often to become a habit or preference. I say that because, my go-to tool for note taking in my workplace is Wunderlist (I have a huge number of lists going on in it and I would personally suggest it to anyone) or my primary code editor. Coming back to the topic, requirement gathering is an age-old task and people use tools like text editors or even a paper to do it. After giving it some thought, I realized how bad it is to gather requirements in wireframe.</p>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./subtraction-reference.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Deprecation Notice\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>\\n\\t\\tSurvey result: Primary tool for brainstorming and ideation. <i>Ref: <a href=\\\"http://tools.subtraction.com/brainstorming.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">subtraction.com</a></i>\\n\\t</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>Wireframes are usually a place to iterate before jumping into a high-fidelity mock. I have seen at times designers being reluctant to move away from their initial iteration, sometimes it’s a complex scenario they are dealing which is difficult but other times, it’s that wireframe which they used to collect requirement standing as a virtual roadblock. The mind tends to fall back to that wireframe whenever a requirement has to be processed and without the designer realizing it, he/she tend to feed the same solution in most of their iterations. The resultant mockup usually looks close to the wireframe and by the time the designer takes up another iteration (which mostly is after the review process and if the design is flagged to be insufficient), it becomes very late in terms of delivery.</p>\\n<p>Now looking at it retrospectively, setting up a process would help us address these problems. What if, the root cause remained undetected? That would mean, the consequence would never change. It’s difficult to detect a cause like this one, since this remains is an elementary step which often is a personal preference and changing it is slightly difficult. This is the same case even for a developer, sticking to the initial pseudo code without thinking much about problem would lead to a recursive cycle of the same error or issue without arriving to a conclusion. By the time the developer realizes it, good amount of time would have been wasted already.</p>\\n<p>When thinking about it, this is what I am opinionated to as of now, one has to take notes subjectively without thinking about the solution in any shape or form when doing it. Even if, a solution is to be recorded while gathering the requirement its absolutely necessary that, the person has to go the extra mile to find all the other possible ways of solving it, before iterating upon one solution. Also, I am going to take this up in my future conversations with the designers &amp; developers and see how they feel about it.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./articles/2015-12-10-requirement-gathering/index.md\n ** module id = 481\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"The Next Iteration\",\"date\":\"2016-09-29T20:03:27.663Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"journal/the-next-iteration/\",\"readNext\":\"journal/blogging-restart/\",\"category\":\"\",\"description\":\"I'm doing yet another iteration on my website.

Unlike the previous versions, I want the next one to hold for a longer timespan. In the coming weeks, I will be logging the process here, so it can stay as a reference material.</em></p>\\n<h3>Problem(s)</h3>\\n<p>The last version had some teething problem in terms of logging data across the sections. Whenever I dealt with new content, either the setup was getting in the way or the templates. In hindsight, Angular and Jekyll setup didn’t really workout and gh-pages wasn’t ideal in maintaining the blog and the portfolio as separate entities. Apparently, I lost the setup for the blog and the re-setup was slightly tedious that I couldn’t fire up the blog again. I want to avoid all this aggravation in the next version and keep the logging process simple.</p>\\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\\n<p>The content is going to be in Markdown, so that’s sorted. Now, the choices are between compiling the markdown on the browser using a JS parser or generate a compiled markup during deployment and then serve it as static pages or as services. If I approach it with the latter choice, then the app might involve a back-end module using ExpressJS and to host it, either Heroku or Firebase can a good option.</p>\\n<h3>Designs</h3>\\n<p>I’ve some wireframes sketched out and also designed few mockups to get a direction on the design elements. Upon completion of the mockups, it looked plenty enough for me to start the work. As far as iterations on the designs are concerned, usually I do it on the browser while coding and I want to follow the same approach for this one. The design elements are going to be sort kind of a chart, and the idea is to consume my <a href=\\\"https://www.rescuetime.com/\\\">RescueTime</a> data and display the analytics at a high level for the initial release. This will allow me to gather data from multiple devices and publish it to a single public interface.</p>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./wireframes-homepage.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Landing page wireframes\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Landing page wireframes</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./v6_landing_2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Landing page design mock\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Landing page design mock</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>The idea of habit and time-tracking tools were something that I wanted to develop for sometime. Meanwhile, when I was thinking about the various ways to approach this, Gyroscope was released. It’s an app that consolidates all the user’s data from multiple devices into a single interface. There are few other services which does this but I felt that Gyroscope is superior, mostly because of its beautiful design. I got inspired by the app and then it lead to a rough idea on how I can approach my site. To set things clear, I am gonna try hard enough not to copy anything intentionally from there, which by itself is a stern design challenge.</p>\\n<h3>What’s ahead?</h3>\\n<p>The plan is to keep the portfolio and the blog section separate as similar to the old site. Only this time around, I’ve to be extra careful in managing the modules being independent. To achieve that, I’m planning to build the whole technical solution using a single framework. After using NG2 for an app at work, I was quite convinced with it and I’ve been working with AngularJS for quite sometime now, which has left me wondering on the other JS frameworks that are out there. I want to check things on Aurelia and ReactJS, which looked particularly interesting that on the others. Especially, the React ecosystem sounds more interesting and the added buzz makes it more appealing. I think its the right time to do this project as an experiment with the concepts of React.</p>\\n<p>With some much in the backlog and other projects taking majority of my time, its going to be tricky to manage time in the coming days. But I’ve wasted enough time postponing this work and I’m just excited to work with React.</p>\\n<h4>More designs</h4>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./wireframes-blogpost.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Journal design wireframes\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Journal reference wireframes</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<figure style=\\\"margin-bottom: 50px;\\\">\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./v6_landing_1.png\\\" alt=\\\"Landing page design mock\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Another version of hero section</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./articles/2016-09-30-the-next-iteration/index.md\n ** module id = 482\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Angular 1.x Component & Routes\",\"date\":\"2017-01-04T09:59:59.932Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"path\":\"journal/ng-component-routes/\",\"readNext\":\"journal/requirement-gathering/\",\"category\":\"\",\"description\":\"Using the ui-router beta with NG 1.5.x component and porting the old modules & routes to the new UI router.\",\"body\":\"<p><em>Using the ui-router beta with ng 1.5.x component and porting the old routers to the new UI router.</em></p>\\n<p>The intention of this post is to quickly log my experience with an angular 1.5+ based application. I have been working on several angular projects for quite some time now, most of the projects are 1.x based and few are on ng2. Among those 1.x projects, there was huge one which started on v1.3.x sometime back in 2015. I joined this project late 2016 for a new development activity. By this time, I recently completed some work on a ng2 project and from the experiences of it, I knew sooner or later we had to port the current app slowly towards component based approach. So, we planned out the framework upgrades incrementally and started rolling out them one by one. The initial upgrades were quite easy without much breaking changes and when we hit 1.5.0, we were excited to start using the component pattern.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component\\\">angular docs</a> was a good place to start and the <a href=\\\"https://toddmotto.com/angular-1-5-lifecycle-hooks\\\">blog</a> <a href=\\\"https://toddmotto.com/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method/\\\">posts</a> from <a href=\\\"https://toddmotto.com/one-way-data-binding-in-angular-1-5/\\\">Todd</a> were all really helpful in terms of dealing with the new patterns. We started off creating new components as widgets for the app. The app’s core module was a form builder of sorts. This module consisted of many widgets, which were supposed to be reused and the obvious thing was to hit the component approach in full throttle. For the routing part, we looked at the angular’s in-house router, and it had a warning sign for deprecation. But there was reference pointing to use the ui-router’s component version.</p>\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img src=\\\"./ngrouterannouncement.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Deprecation Notice\\\">\\n\\t<figcaption>Deprecation Notice: Component Router for AngularJS 1.5</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n<p>The ui-router’s setup was slick since we were already using an old version of ui-router and we had to deal with few broken routes while porting but it was worth it. The form builder module itself deserves a separate log, I will try to cover it later. If not, I will record it as a workflow/case-study in the new site that I’m working on. So, the route configuration looks like this:</p>\\n<script src=\\\"https://gist.github.com/k97/adb17ef598ac2abd3a84ea6e9fc88aec.js\\\"></script>\\n<p>It obviously addressed the concerns of tightly coupling the views with controllers and promote reusable pieces of code. Another big sigh of relief was passing the state via the router. Now thanks to the bindings of ng 1.5 component pattern, we can use and abuse property bindings, event lifecycle hooks and mostly importantly setup the codebase more favorable for a ng-upgrade towards ng2.</p>\\n<p>As a hot tip, one-way binding is pretty easy now with the component pattern and the new router. When creating any component with bindings, just make sure it’s started with one-way binding. Most of the functionality can be achieved this way and if some edge case crops up, then we can revisit that particular property with other means. By using the component bindings, I was able to refactor the old functionality which existed earlier as two-way binding hell to a slick one-way data flow.</p>\\n<p>The next slick thing that was really easy to create and maintain was a dynamic widget creation as scope-isolated components. Long story short, the components were created from a configuration through an attribute directive and then compiled to a DOM element through <code>$compile</code> before injecting back to the app. Once added to the DOM, the element starts to run as an usual ng component. This basically, gave us the flexibility to create dynamic components and reuse the configuration across the app. The directive looks something like the below:</p>\\n<script src=\\\"https://gist.github.com/k97/09ebb01cde3849427bab3327d598b127.js\\\"></script>\\n<p>The next planned activity is to fully modularize the app with ES6 modules before starting the ng-upgrade, which is planned down the line. But looking at the router set up and the lesser state dependency with other modules, I think the upgrade should be quite simple and straight forward.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./articles/2017-01-04-ng-component-route/index.md\n ** module id = 483\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","import React from 'react'\nimport { Link } from 'react-router'\nimport sortBy from 'lodash/sortBy'\nimport moment from 'moment'\nimport DocumentTitle from 'react-document-title'\nimport { prefixLink } from 'gatsby-helpers'\nimport access from 'safe-access'\nimport { config } from 'config'\nimport SitePost from '../components/SitePost'\nimport SiteSidebar from '../components/SiteSidebar'\n\nclass SiteIndex extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        const pageLinks = []\n        // Sort pages.\n        const sortedPages = sortBy(this.props.route.pages, (page) => access(page, 'data.date')\n        ).reverse()\n        sortedPages.forEach((page) => {\n            if (access(page, 'file.ext') === 'md' && access(page, 'data.layout') === 'post') {\n                const title = access(page, 'data.title') || page.path\n                const description = access(page, 'data.description')\n                const datePublished = access(page, 'data.date')\n                const category = access(page, 'data.category')\n\n                pageLinks.push(\n                    <div className='blog-post'>\n                      <time dateTime={ moment(datePublished).format('MMMM D, YYYY') }>\n                        { moment(datePublished).format('DD MMM YYYY') }\n                      </time>\n                      <span className='blog-category'>{ category }</span>\n                      <h2><Link style={ {    borderBottom: 'none',} } to={ prefixLink(page.path) } > { title } </Link></h2>\n                      <p dangerouslySetInnerHTML={ {    __html: description} } />\n                      <Link className='readmore' to={ prefixLink(page.path) }> Read\n                      </Link>\n                    </div>\n                )\n            }\n        })\n\n        return (\n            <DocumentTitle title={ config.siteTitle }>\n              <div>\n                <SiteSidebar {...this.props}/>\n                <div className='content'>\n                  <div className='main'>\n                    <div className='main-inner'>\n                      { pageLinks }\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n            </DocumentTitle>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nSiteIndex.propTypes = {\n    route: React.PropTypes.object,\n}\n\nexport default SiteIndex\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./index.jsx\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"About me\",\"layout\":\"page\",\"path\":\"/about\",\"body\":\"<p><strong>Karthikeyan Rajendran</strong> is an <strong>UI/UX Engineer</strong>, currently working for Emirates Airlines, Dubai.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./pages/about/index.md\n ** module id = 485\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Contact me\",\"layout\":\"page\",\"path\":\"/contact\",\"body\":\"<p>Send me a tweet at <a href=\\\"http://www.twitter.com/k97ind\\\">@k97ind</a></p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./pages/contact/index.md\n ** module id = 486\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/"],"sourceRoot":""}
