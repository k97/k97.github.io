					<p>Hi all! It is burning hot in Chennai with soaring temperatures and dust dispersing all across, our city is progressing slowly in its infrastructure. It is almost the same kind of development in my career lately, a much required & desired stride towards mobile application development. Little did I know about the timing of it, as I was premeditated with lot of things in web development, a new project involving quite an amount of data and also my very own website. Anyway, its official now and I have made the switch, so I will be dedicated to UI/UX in mobile apps for the next part of my career.</p>
					<p>I am pretty sure that it will not be the end of my involvement in the web but it will be more like taking a different approach to walk through the technology. I always wanted to showcase my concepts & prototypes that I have done and about to enact but with all the non-disclosure agreements in check, I guess that won’t be possible. But I will share my thoughts and personal projects from now on, which is why I am planning (re) designing my own website alongside this blog. I am sharing few shots of the new design which utilizes the presentation-concept of blurred background as I simply couldn’t get it off my mind and also also it incorporates transparency to a certain limit.</p>
